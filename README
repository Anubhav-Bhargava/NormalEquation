This is the Python implementation of the Normal Equation algorithm.
This algorithm is a faster way to get the proper value of weights as compared to the Gradient Descent algorithm.
Here it is used to train the neural network to add two numbers.

Dependencies:-
Numpy

Execution 
To run the example, simpy run normal_equation.py file using python
python normal_equation.py

The output will look like this:-

Initial value of weights
[ 0.4359949   0.02592623]
Final value of weights
[ 1.  1.]
Addition of 34 and 6 is equal to
[ 40.]
